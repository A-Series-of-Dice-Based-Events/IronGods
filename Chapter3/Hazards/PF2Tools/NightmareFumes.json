Any breathing creature in the room is exposed to the toxin. If a creature acts before the trap on the first round, it has the option of holding its breath to postpone breathing in the poison - holding one's breath after the trap's first action has no effect. The trap functions for 1 minute before all the gas is expended, after which it rapidly decays. Forcing open the door to the library initially exposes anyone else in both rooms to Nightmare Fumes, but the gas becomes too diluted to affect creatures on the trap's next action - disabling it.\nNightmare Fumes (inhaled, mental, poison) Saving Throw DC 30 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6 hours; Stage 1 slowed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 unconscious with no Perception check to wake up (1 round); Stage 3 unconscious with no Perception check to wake up.
