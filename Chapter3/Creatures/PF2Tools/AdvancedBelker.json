On a failure, the creature partially inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing and succeeding at a DC 28 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature's space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"ne","size":"large","type":"elemental","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"high","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet, fly 40 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"+3","benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+7","benchmark":"high","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-2","benchmark":"abysmal","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"0","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+19","benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision, smoke vision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"+22","benchmark":"high","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"+22","benchmark":"high","note":"+24 in smoke"},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"31","benchmark":"high","note":""},"hp":{"value":"140","benchmark":"low","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"18","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"+22","benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":"17","benchmark":"low","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"bleed, paralyzed, poison, precision, sleep","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_2baov8sem5n","name":"claw","traits":"agile, finesse","attack":"+23","damage":"2d10+12 slashing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_8p09kt5qjfo","name":"wing","traits":"agile, finesse, reach 10ft","attack":"+23","damage":"2d8+12 bludgeoning","type":"Melee"}]}
