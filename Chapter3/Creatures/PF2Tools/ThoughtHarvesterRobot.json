The contents of the memory is up to the GM's discretion. It may be close to the memory desired by the thought harvester, but not the exact one it's looking for.\nFailure A specific memory is extracted from the creature. The creature becomes stupefied 1.\nCritical Failure As failure, but the creature becomes stupefied 2 instead.\nExtracted memories are stored in one of the crystal spheres on the thought harvester's back, which can be removed with a successful DC 30 Disable a Device check and read by certain devices.
