## Eversmoking Bottle

**Level** 9; **Price** 650 gp; **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Effect** You uncork the eversmoking bottle, causing a 5-foot burst of smoke to appear centered on a corner of your space. All creatures in the area are concealed, and all other creatures concealed to them. The burst of smoke increases in size by 5 feet each round until it becomes a 20-foot burst. This smoke lasts until the bottle is corked, after which the smoke disspates in 1 minute or is dispersed by a strong wind.

**Activate** (1 action) command; **Requirements** The eversmoking bottle is uncorked; **Effect** The eversmoking bottle corks itself magically, saving its owner from having to try to find and cork it manually amidst the smoke.

## Hearth Mantle

**Level** 7; **Price** 350 gp; **Usage** worn around neck; **Bulk** L

A *hearth mantle* is itself immune to fire damage. Its wearer upon investing gains resistance 5 to fire damage.

**Activate** (Free action) Envision; **Frequency** once a day; **Effect** You cause the *hearth mantle* to lightly smoulder for 1 minute. While smouldering, the *hearth mantle* sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light in the next 20 feet.

**Activate** (1 minute) Interact; **Effect** You lay the mantle on the ground with its exterior facing up. A campfire ignites on the mantle's fire rune, burning for 8 hours without needing any fuel.

## Nuglub-Skin Drum

**Level** 5; **Price** 35 gp; **Usage** held in 2 hands **Bulk** 1
