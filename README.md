# Iron Gods

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

A repository to hold tools for those wishing to run and convert Iron Gods to Pathfinder 2E.

The README.md files can have simple breakdowns of modified DCs for various tasks brought up in the Adventure while the individual folders can hold the files for the monster/NPC stat blocks.

## How to use this conversion

This conversion is meant to be used as a companion to official Paizo published works, not as a replacement for them. You are expected to have purchased the source books yourself as this document only contains what is necessary to convert the items into 2nd edition.

Therefore if an entry is missing something in this guide, treat it as if it is unchanged from its entry in its source book.

## Recommended Tool

<http://monster.pf2.tools/> uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files.
