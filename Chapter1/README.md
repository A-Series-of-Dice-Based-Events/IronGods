## Recommended Tool

http://monster.pf2.tools/ uses JSON files that can be easily imported/exported. This repository ideally will hold those files publicly sourced and created, as well as other tools/files. 
Please do not submit PDF files or entire texts of the AP. Only submit modifications for the DC and NPCs/Monsters. Please also include a page number/map section label so GMs can cross-reference.
