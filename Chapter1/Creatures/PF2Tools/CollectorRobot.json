Once implanted, the chip is activated and the collector robot's integrated chipfinder can detect the presence of the chip within 1 mile.  \n\nIt uses a signal to locate the tracker chips, and this signal can be blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone or 20 feet of organic matter.\n\nA tracker chip can be removed with a sharp tool dealing 1 point of piercing damage. Once an implanted chip is removed from the body - or if the body dies - it retains enough energy to continue to be detected by the collector robot for 1 week."},{"id":"_1grpi27wg2o","name":"Construct Armor","traits":"","range":"","actions":"none","type":"defense","description":"Like normal objects, a collector robot has Hardness.
