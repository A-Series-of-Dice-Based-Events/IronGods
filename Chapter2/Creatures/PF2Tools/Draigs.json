Neither head can Delay. At the start of a head's turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls one of the ettin's arms, but both can move the legs. Any ability that would sever an ettin's head (such as the vorpal weapon property) doesn't cause the ettin to die if it still has its other head, but does cause it to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head. Mental effects that target a single creature affect only one of the ettin's heads."},{"id":"_2i5gfgem088","name":"Power Attack","traits":"","range":"","actions":"two","type":"offense","description":"as the fighter feat"}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"ce","size":"large","type":"humanoid","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"+1 spiked chain, lesser healing potion (2), moderate healing potion, leather armor","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"35 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"+6","benchmark":"high","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"-1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"-2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"0","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"19","benchmark":"moderate","note":"low-luight vision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":24,"benchmark":"low","note":""},"hp":{"value":"165","benchmark":"high","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"19","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"14","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"15","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_2byxj976sr6","name":"+1 spiked chain","traits":"disarm, finesse, trip, reach 10 ft","attack":"19","damage":"2d8+10 slashing","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_84bvmwnax5","name":"fist","traits":"agile, reach 10 ft","attack":"19","damage":"1d6+10  bludgeoning","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"pidgin of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish"}
