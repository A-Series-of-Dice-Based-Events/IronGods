Sevroth Slaid is built after an elite [Ganzi Martial Artist](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1266). Her Brawler's Flurry skill allows her to make two strikes with both her fists or with any melee weapon without a MAP penalty, so feel free to have her pick up other weapons - perhaps confiscated from other would-be guests to Scrapwall - to really make her brawler class shine.
