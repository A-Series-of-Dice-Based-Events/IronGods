## Backgrounds

### Against the Technic League

For whatever reason, you have a grudge against the Technic League. Perhaps you suspect the League was responsible for your parents' deaths, or you could just rankle at the League's open acceptance of slavery, their reputation for sadism and cruelty, or their penchant for hoarding and controlling technological wonders.

* You get an ability boost to any two abilities of your choice.
* You are trained in the Society skill and the Technic League Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.

### Torch Local

You have ties to a prominent local in the town of Torch - the missing wizard Khonnir Baine. If you're a wizard, alchemist or other scholarly type, he may have been your tutor or teacher. If you're of a more martial bent, Khonnir could instead have been a friend or business associate of your parents or patron. Either way your relationship has given you some insight into the residents of Torch.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Torch (town) Lore skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.

### Numerian Archaeologist

Numeria is a land ripe for archaeological exploration. You've studied the strange language associated with its eerie technological ruins, and are eager to start exploring them.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Society skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You also gain Androffan as an additional language.

### Robot Slayer

The strange automatons that plague the wilds of Numeria are a blight upon the world, and the idea that there could be countless more of these creatures lying in wait throughout the region chills your blood.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Survival skill and a Regional Lore skill. You get the Assurance skill feat with a skill of your choice that you are trained in.

### Skymetal Smith

The fires atop Torch Hill have long been a boon to smiths and metalworkers. You've always been fascinated by the fires, and this was to be your first time to use the torch for your own project. You had just begun before the violet flames went out, and you hope to find a way to rekindle the flames.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Craft skill and the Skymetal Lore skill. You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat.

### Stargazer

The concept of life on other planets far beyond Golarion has always fascinated you, and you've long hoped to learn more about what life on those other planets may have been like. Perhaps some of these aliens can be found in Numerian dungeons.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Occultism skill and the Xenobiology Lore skill. You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.
