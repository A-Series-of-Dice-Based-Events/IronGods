# New Traits

Links with a carat (^) designate new entries from this conversion, and will take you to their statblock in this conversion guide.

## General Traits

### Tech

Items with the Tech trait are considered technological items and use the [Identify Technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-technology) action to identify.

Creatures with the Tech trait is powered by or constructed through technological means, and is affected by effects that specifically target technology such as *[rebuke technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#rebuke-technology)*. Most Robots have the Techn trait, but Androids do not.

Hazards or other devices with the Tech trait impose a -5 penalty on all Disable a Device checks against it if the creature making the check does not use an [e-pick^](Gear/README.md#e-pick) charge in the attempt.

## Creature Traits

### AI

AIs, or Artificial Intelligences are sapient entities that cannot interface with the world without being installed into a robot or a structure (known as a host). As such AIs tend not to have any listed stats for physical defenses and ability modifiers, much like an [Intelligent Item](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1084)

AIs can also be augmented with [Memory Facets^](/Chapter2/Items/README.md#memory-facet) by installing them into available slots connected to their central processing.

Destroying the host robot or structure does not destroy the AI fully unless all of its processing was fully housed inside it.

### Aggregate

 When an AI is installed into a Robot, the host robot is known as an Aggregate and is modified as the following:

* The Aggregate gains the AI and Aggregate traits.
* The Aggregate's level increases by up to 2, up to GM's discretion of how much more powerful the AI is than it.
* The Aggregate's Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma modifiers are replaced with those of the AI's.
* The Aggregate's Perception score is replaced with that of the AI's if it is higher.
* The Aggregate replaces its Will save with the AI's while retaining its own Fortitude and Reflex saves.
* The Aggregate gains all of the AI's special abilities while retaining its own.
* The Aggregate gains all of the AI's skills while retaining its own, using the higher of the two if they double up.
* The Aggregate gains [all-around vision](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1) if they are in an area fitted with cameras or other sensors that are under the control of the AI.

Unless the processing for the installed AI is entirely within the Aggregate, destroying the Aggregate does not destroy the AI.

### Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrials are creatures that are from a different planet than Golarion. Surprisingly enough, this is actually less common than Outsiders or creatures from other planes.

Extraterrestrials typically have the Rare trait.

### Robot

A creature can only have one of these three traits: Robot, Golem or Clockwork. e.g. a Golem cannot be a Robot, nor can a Robot be a Clockwork.

Robots are Constructs like Golems or Clockworks, but if Golems are the dumb, bruteish type of Construct and Clockworks are the intricate, dextrous kind, then Robots would be the intelligent, sensitive type. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.

Robots typically follow the following template:

* **Intelligent:** Most Robots do NOT have the Mindless trait, and in fact are usually trained in a mental skill corresponding to their functionality. For example the Medical Drone in Part 4 would be trained in Medicine. This also means they are susceptible to effects with the Mental trait.
* **Terrible Saving Throws:** Unless a Robot is specifically designed for combat, such as the Myrmidon Robot, they typically have Low to Abysmal saving throws on the monster creation guidelines.
* **Weak to Electricity:** Like Clockworks, Robots typically have a weakness to electricity with a value that lies within the monster creation guidelines.
* **Construct Armor:** Replacing the *Vulnerable to critical hits* trait from 1e, the common monster ability Construct Armor demonstrates a Robot's weakness to critical hits instead.

Outside of Numeria, Robots may have the Rare trait but within the land they only have Uncommon as many of the citizens there have at least heard of one.

## Effect Traits

### Beam

Beams are rays of focused energy from technological sources that capable of inflicting a variety of effects - painful or otherwise. Some equipment, such as the [Scatterlight Suit](/Technology%20Guide/Armor/README.md#scatterlight-suit) are specifically designed to counter such rays. 

Note that a beam is specifically technologic in nature. Spells such as [*ray of enfeeblement*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=244) do not get affected by anything that affects beams.

### Laser

Lasers are beams of intensely focused light capable of burning anything it strikes. Weapons and effects with the Laser trait are unaffected by force barriers and transparent physical barriers like windows. Invisible creatures are immune to Laser effects and damage from a Laser weapon.

### Plasma

Plasma is superheated, electrically charged gas. Effects with the plasma trait typically deal both fire and electricity damage in equal amounts. For effects that deal persistent damage, treat it as dealing persistent fire damage only.

## Equipment Traits

### Grenade

A grenade is a device designed to detonate after being thrown. See [Grenade^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#grenade) for more details.

### Module

Items with the Module trait usually need to be slotted in another item before they can provide their full functionality. Modules often have different variants, allowing those with the receptacle item to change their functionality depending on what variant of module is inserted.

### Pharmaceutical

A Pharmaceutical is typically an alchemical consumable that is activated by either ingesting them, or having them injected into a creature with the use of a [medlance^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#medlance). To identify a pharmaceutical, use the [Identify Pharmaceutical^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-pharmaceutical) action.

### Powered

Items with the Powered trait require electronic power to activate, which usually come in the form of battery charges but can also be gotten directly from a power generator's yield (See full rules on power generators in *[Technology Guide, pg. 62](https://paizo.com/products/btpy98i0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide)*). Most powered items list a 'Capacity' entry to indicate how many charges it can store, and a 'Power Use' entry to show how many charges are used per activation.

### Signal

Items with the Signal trait can remotely interact with other objects via a wireless signal. Signals usually state their range in their entries and are affected according to the sidebar on *[Technology Guide, pg. 43](https://paizo.com/products/btpy98i0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide)*
