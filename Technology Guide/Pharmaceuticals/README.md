# Pharmaceuticals

All pharmaceuticals have the following properties:

* negligible bulk
* held in one hand
* take a single Interact action to activate
* have these traits: Alchemical, Consumable, [Pharmaceutical^](/Traits/README.md#pharmaceutical)

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Cardioamp

**Additional Traits** Healing

**Level** 9; **Price** 250 gp; **Craft DC** 30

When administered to a creature that has died in the past minute, the creature can immediately attempt a DC20 Fortitude saving throw. On a success, the creature returns to life, stabilised at 0 HP.

The creature returns to life with no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and with any long-term debilitations of the old body. They are also clumsy 2, drained 2 and enfeebled 2 for 1 day.

A living creature injected with cardioamp must make a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw.

* **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected
* **Success** The creature becomes sickened 1
* **Failure** The creature becomes drained 2 and sickened 1
* **Critical Failure** The creature goes into cardiac arrest. They take 3d6 poison damage and become stunned 2 and drained 2.

## Cureall

**Additional Traits** Healing

**Level** 8; **Price** 85 gp; **Craft DC** 25

A dose of Cureall allows the target to attempt an additional saving throw against a single disease or poison affliction currently affecting them, regardless of whether the stage of the affliction has passed yet.

Cureall also lowers the value of the target's clumsy, drained, enfeebled and stupefied conditions by 1.

## Hemochem

**Additional Traits** Healing

Grade | Level | Cost   | Craft DC
------|-------|--------|----------
I     | 4     | 20 gp  | 23
II    | 5     | 30 gp  | 24
III   | 6     | 55 gp  | 25
IV    | 7     | 75 gp  | 26
V     | 8     | 100 gp | 27

## Torpinol

**Additional Traits** Mental

**Level** 4; **Price** 18 gp per dose; **Craft DC** 25

*Note: This is based off of the [truth potion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=200).*

Torpinol has a one-minute onset time and its effects last for 10 minutes. The effects can be resisted with a successful DC 12 Will save. Each additional dose administered during this one-minute onset time forces a new Will save, with the DC increasing by 2 to a maximum of 22.

* **Success** Torpinol does not affect the target.
* **Failure** When the target speaks, they must tell the truth.
* **Critical Failure** As failure, and when someone asks the target a question, they must attempt another Will save at the DC of the roll they failed at. If they fail this saving throw, they must answer the question truthfully if they are able to do so; if they succeed, they are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the same question within the pharmaceutical's duration.
