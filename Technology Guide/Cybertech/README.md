# Cybertech

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Mechanics Overview

Cybertech is technology that must be implanted within a creature's body before it functions.

Each piece of cybertech has an Implantation value that indicates how invasive the implant is. The total combined implantation values of all cybertech implanted in a single creature cannot exceed their Constitution or Intelligence [score](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=74), or they take a -4 item penalty to all saving throws

Each piece of cybertech also fits into a specific body slot listed in its statblock. A creature cannot have more than one piece of cybertech in a body slot.

After a piece of cybertech has been installed in a creature, its bulk no longer counts towards that creature's encumbrance.

To install or remove cybertech on a living creature, use one of the following actions. Removing a piece of cybertech from a dead body requires no Medicine check but takes a number of rounds equal to its Implantation score.

### Install Cybertech

**Traits:** Downtime, Concentration, Manipulate

**Requirements:** Trained in Medicine. You are wearing or holding [Healer's Tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=25).

You take a number of hours equal to a piece of cybertech's Implantation score to attempt to install it into a creature. The creature must be unconscious or otherwise helpless for the entire duration, and if this time is interrupted in any way, the procedure fails. Make a Medicine check against the cybertech's Install DC.

* **Critical Success** You successfully install the cybertech into the creature with no adverse effects.

* **Failure** You fail to install the cybertech into the creature. It becomes drained with the value being that of the cybertech's Implantation score. You cannot try again until the creature recovers from its drained status.
* **Critical Failure** As failure, but the cybertech gains the broken condition.

## Cybertech List

### Skillslot

**Traits** Rare, Cybertech, [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Level** 5; **Price** 120 gp; **Slot** brain; **Bulk** L; **Install DC** 30; **Implanatation** 1; **Craft DC** 28

A skillslot requires a [skillchip](../Gear/README.md#skillchip) to be inserted for it to provide any effect to the person it is installed in.

It takes 10 minutes for a skillchip to adjust itself to a new skillslot; during this time, the user is considered fascinated on the new sensations flooding their mind. When a skillchip is removed, its benefits end immediately, but the wearer suffers no ill effects.
