# Technological Weapons

This section is likely going to be the most controversial of all the conversions as everyone has a different take on how firearms should work (at least until Guns and Gears comes out). So for the most part these are only going to be conversions for levels, price and bulk.

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1 round on a failed save. A flare can also be extinguished with a 2-action interact action.
