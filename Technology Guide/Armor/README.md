Before activation, a panic suit is a fist-sized plastic sphere.

**Activate** (reaction) Interact;  **Effect** The sphere envelopes the creature holding it in a full-body protective suit. While activated, it provides immunity to low radiation and resistance 5 against all forms of energy except sonic damage. Its air filters grant a +2 status bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and diseases.

A panic suit is a single-use item. When its charges run out or its wearer deactivates it, it falls apart into useless fragments.
