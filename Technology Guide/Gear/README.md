# Technological Gear

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Battery

**Traits** Uncommon, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 10 gp; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 25

A battery contains 10 charges when full. It is a single Interact action to insert or eject a battery from an item. Much like a [repeating](http://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=374) weapon, it is often 3 Interact actions to replace an empty battery (eject used battery, retrieve new battery, insert new battery). When recharging a battery at a generator, roll a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, the battery is destroyed and becomes a useless silverdisk.

## Commset

**Traits** Rare, [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 12; **Price** 2,000 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Craft DC** 27

When a message is broadcast on a commset, all other active commsets tuned to the same frequency within 1 mile will play the broadcasted message. Activating or deactivating a commset is a single interact action, and the commset uses 1 charge of power for each hour it remains active. Inactive commsets will not receive, play or broadcast messages.

Broadcasting a message on a commset records video and audio footage of the creature doing so.

## Chemalyzer

**Traits** Rare, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 150 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** 1; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/use; **Craft DC** 25

When used it grants a +2 item bonus to any Identify Alchemy and Identify Pharmaceutical checks. It cannot aid in the identification of magical effects or substances (like potions) but it does work on Alchemical Elixirs. This cannot be used in lieu of [Alchemist's tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2).

## Cylex

**Traits** Uncommon, [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 7; **Price** 70 gp; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 26

Cylex can be triggered to explode by using a Detonator or applying 10 or more points of electricity damage to it in a single turn. When detonated each use of cylex deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage and 6d6 fire damage to all creatures and objects within a 40-foot radius (basic DC 15 Reflex).

## Detonator

**Traits** [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 30 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/use; **Craft DC** 23

## E-pick

**Traits** [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Hands** 2; **Bulk** L **Capacity** 10

Without expending a charge on an e-pick, Pick a Lock and Disable a Device checks on technological devices suffer a -5 penalty. Higher grade models of e-picks provide an item bonus to those checks. However, e-picks cannot be used on non-technological devices and they cannot substitute for regular picks in Thieves' tools.

Grade     | Level | Item Bonus | Craft DC | Rarity   | Cost
----------|-------|------------|----------|----------|-------
Brown     | 1     | 0          | 21       | Uncommon | 3 gp
Black     | 3     | +1         | 24       | Uncommon | 15 gp
Gray      | 9     | +2         | 26       | Rare     | 110 gp
Blue      | 12    | +3         | 29       | Rare     | 350 gp
Prismatic | 19    | +4         | 31       | Rare     | 800 gp

*Note: There's less grades here than given in the actual Technology Guide. This is because gaining an item bonus higher than 3 is almost impossible in 2e while the Technology Guide wanted to give you a +5 by Level 4.*

## Emergency Beacon

**Traits** Uncommon, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 55 gp; **Usage** structure; **Bulk** 2 **Capacity** 30; **Power Use** 1 charge/8 hours; **Craft DC** 25.

A DC 15 Track action can follow the beacon's signal.

## Emergency Raft

**Traits** Uncommon, Consumable, Gadget, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech), Vehicle

**Level** 8; **Price** 200 gp; **Usage** vehicle; **Bulk** 2 **Craft DC** 24

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** You command the emergency raft to unfurl. It quickly becomes a [Rowboat](https://2e.aonprd.com/Vehicles.aspx?ID=8)

## Emergency Shelter

**Traits** Rare, Consumable, Gadget, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), Structure, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 10; **Price** 1,000 gp; **Usage** structure; **Bulk** 2; **Power Use** 1 charge/8 hours; **Craft DC** 24

**Activate** (1 minute) Interact; **Frequency** 3 times a day; **Effect** The egg-shaped device rapidly unfolds into a hut capable of providing shelter for 6 Medium creatures. The climate inside the hut is comfortable and allows creatures inside it to withstand all hostile weather conditions, powerful storms, and winds provided it was anchored on solid ground. Creatures inside the hut become immune to inhaled poisons and diseases originating from outside the hut.

The emergency shelter can be unfurled with a single Interact action provided there are no foreign elements inside it.

## Filter Mask

**Traits** Uncommon, Air, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 250 gp; **Usage** worn mask; **Bulk** L **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Craft DC** 24.

Wearing the mask gives a +2 item bonus to all saving throws made to resist inhaled poisons and diseases even when not activated.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour **Effect** The creature wearing the mask becomes immune to all inhaled poisons and diseases.

## Fire Extinguisher

**Traits** Consumable, Gadget

**Level** 6; **Price** 400 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1; **Uses** 10; **Craft DC** 26

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** You create 15 foot cone of misty vapor that extinguishes all nonmagical fires within its area of effect. For each continuous magical fire effect in the cone, make a counteract check at a +11 modifier. If it succeeds the effect is suppressed for 1 minute before it automatically reignites. A creature affected by persistent fire damage within the cone of effect may make a DC 10 flat check to end their condition immediately.

**Activate** (2 actions) Ready; **Effect** You ready the fire extinguisher to put out any potential sources of instantaneous fire such as a [*fireball*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=119). If the source of fire is within a 15-foot cone of you, you may use your reaction to make a counteract check at a +11 modifier to counter the effect entirely.

## Flashlight

**Traits** Light, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 3 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/8 hours; **Craft DC** 16

A flashlight emits bright light in a 60 foot cone and dim light in the next 60 feet when activated.

## Goo Tube

**Traits** Consumable

**Price** 3 sp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -; **Craft DC** 14

## Gravity Clip

**Traits** Uncommon, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 120 gp; **Usage** affixed to weapon; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/round; **Craft DC** 26

Once affixed to a melee weapon, the first successful weapon Strike made with it each round gains a status bonus to damage equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice - as if were under the effects of [*gravity weapon*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=770).

## Grenade

**Traits** Uncommon, Bomb, Consumable, [Grenade^](/Traits/README.md#grenade), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 20

Grenades are explosives that can be thrown anywhere within 60 feet, with an area of effect as a 20-foot burst. However it is similar to beads on a *[necklace of fireballs](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=449)* where if it is a particularly difficult situation the GM may ask you to make an attack roll (treat as a bomb: martial proficiency with a 20 foot range increment).

Grenades need to be armed before activating, and go off at the start of the user's next turn after being primed - regardless if it has been thrown or not. When a grenade goes off, targets in the area of effect usually have to make a basic Reflex save; the DC and effect depends on the grenade.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Effect** You arm the grenade. It will activate at the start of your next turn, whether you have thrown it or not.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact (ranged); **Effect** You toss the grenade at any area within 60 feet. If this action is disrupted - such as by a critical hit from an [Attack of Opportunity](http://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=8) - you drop the grenade on the ground directly beneath you.

Here is a list of the various kinds of grenades and their effects.

Grenade               | Level | Price  | Save DC       | Extra Traits      | Effect
----------------------|-------|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------

Bang Grenade          | 3     | 15 gp  | Fort 23       | Auditory          | On a failure, creatures are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a critical failure, creature is deafened for 1 minute and stunned 1
Bio Grenade           | 10    | 200 gp | Fort 15       | Disease           | Infects targets with [Bubonic Plague](http://2e.aonprd.com/Diseases.aspx?ID=6) with no onset

Flash Grenade         | 1     | 5 gp   | Fort 20       | Light, Visual     | Creatures are blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute. Creatures blinded this way can spend 1 interact action rubbing their eyes to end the blinded condition
Flechette Grenade     | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 piercing damage
Fragmentation Grenade | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 slashing damage

Zero Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Cold              | 5d6 cold damage

## Grippers

**Level** 1; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 14

Grippers can be used like a crowbar, negating the -2 item penalty to pry something open without one. To pull apart two items attached together with Grippers requires a DC 22 Athletics check.

Grippers can also be used in combat.

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** Make a Strike, treating the grippers as an improvised weapon. On a successful hit, the grippers deal 1d4+7 points of bludgeoning damage.

## Hologram Generator

**Traits** [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Craft DC** 26

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** You project an image from one of the holograms stored in the generator's memory banks within 500 feet. The type of image depends on the colour grade of the hologram generator (see below), but must fit within a 20-foot burst. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve the illusion with a Will Save.

Grade     | Level | Hologram Type                                   | Will DC  | Extra Traits                  | Cost
----------|-------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|-------
Brown     | 1     | Static image only                               | 15       | Uncommon, Visual              | 15 gp
Black     | 3     | Animated image, no sound                        | 18       | Uncommon, Visual              | 60 gp
White     | 5     | Animated image with sound                       | 20       | Rare, Visual, Auditory        | 180 gp
Blue      | 13    | Animated image with sound and touch (see below) | 31       | Rare, Visual, Auditory, Force | 3,000 gp

Blue grade hologram projectors enable the image to interact with the environment through manipulating graviton fields. This allows for creative uses as the following:

- If a creature is generated, it gains the minion trait (acts on your turn, gains 2 actions with Command an Animal). Its attack modifier is +14 and any DCs it may use for offensive abilities is 22. Any damage it does is equal to 20 damage or what the projected creature would have dealt (including resistances), whichever is lower. This damage is always force damage.
  - As an example, a creature with slashing resist 5 being hit with a project creature's attack that would have dealt 15 slashing damage before resistance would take 10 force damage.
- If a barrier is generated, the barrier has Hardness 10, HP 40 (BT 20).

## Ion Tape

**Traits** Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 3; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 14

When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Escape check to break.

**Level** 10; **Price** 1000 gp; **Usage** attached to firearm or crossbow (scope); **Bulk** L; **Capacity** 10; **Craft DC** 27

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Effect** You activate the laser sight, emitting a low-power laser that paints a small red dot on the target. While this device is activated, all attack rolls made with this weapon gain a +1 circumstance bonus.

## Magboots

**Level** 4; **Price** 100 gp; **Usage** worn shoes; **Bulk** 1; **Craft DC** 20

**Activate** (Free) Envision; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Effect** You gain a climb speed equal to your land speed like [*spider climb*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=299) but only on metal surfaces.

## Medlance

**Traits** Uncommon, Injection, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 30 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -; **Craft DC** 23

A medlance doesn't use electrical charges, but after 10 uses its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and it becomes useless.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact or Strike; **Effect** You inject the liquid in the medlance into the target. If the target is unwilling, make a Strike against their AC (treat the medlance as a simple one-handed melee weapon). On a hit you do no damage, but the liquid is injected. This changes the ingested trait on poisons to the injury trait.

## Nanite Canister

**Traits** Rare, Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 30 gp; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 25

## Nanite Hypogun

All nanite hypoguns have two settings.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Nanite Use** 1 charge; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its primary setting. The target recovers hit points according to the Primary column of the table below.

**Activate** varies, usually 10 minutes; **Nanite Use** 5 charges; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its secondary setting. This has the effect listed in the Secondary column of the table below.

Color Grade | Level | Cost      | Craft DC | Primary | Secondary
------------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------

## Skillchip

**Traits** [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge concerning a single Lore skill, granting an item bonus to checks made using that skill. It must be slotted into a [skillslot](../Cybertech/README.md#skillslot) before it can provide the benefits. All skillchips have negligible bulk.

Model    | Level | Cost   | Bonus | Rarity   | Craft DC
---------|-------|--------|-------|----------|---------
Mark I   | 2     | 25 gp  | +1    | Uncommon | 24

**Level** 4; **Price** 30 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1; **Uses** 5; **Craft DC** 20

A trauma pack can be used as [Healer's Tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=25) for the sake of making [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) checks, but if a use is expended the patient is not temporarily immune to further [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) actions made using trauma pack charges.

You cannot use a trauma pack in this fashion for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set above 20.

## Trauma Pack Plus

**Traits** Rare, Healing, [Pharmaceutical^](/Traits/README.md#pharmaceutical)

**Level** 9; **Price** 800 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1; **Uses** 5; **Craft DC** 26

As the trauma pack, but a charge can be also expended to bring a creature that died in the last minute back to life. A creature brought back this way has no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body, but persistent damage is removed.

Trauma pack plus uses can be expended like a trauma pack use for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set up to 30.

## Veemod

**Traits** Rare, [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

Veemods slot into [Veemod Goggles](#veenmod-goggles) and are useless without them. All veemods have negligible bulk.
