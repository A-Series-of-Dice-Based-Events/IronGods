# Technological Gear

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Battery

**Traits** Uncommon, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Price** 10 gp; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 25

A battery contains 10 charges when full. It is a single Interact action to insert or eject a battery from an item. Much like a [repeating](http://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=374) weapon, it is often 3 Interact actions to replace an empty battery (eject used battery, retrieve new battery, insert new battery). When recharging a battery at a generator, roll a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, the battery is destroyed and becomes a useless silverdisk.

## Chemalyzer

**Traits** Rare, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Level** 5; **Price** 150 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** 1; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/use; **Craft DC** 25

When used it grants a +2 item bonus to any Identify Alchemy and Identify Pharmaceutical checks. It cannot aid in the identification of magical effects or substances (like potions) but it does work on Alchemical Elixirs. This cannot be used in lieu of [Alchemist's tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2).

## E-pick

**Traits** [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Hands** 2; **Bulk** L **Capacity** 10

Without expending a charge on an e-pick, Pick a Lock and Disable a Device checks on technological devices suffer a -5 penalty. Higher grade models of e-picks provide an item bonus to those checks. However, e-picks cannot be used on non-technological devices and they cannot substitute for regular picks in Thieves' tools.

Grade     | Level | Item Bonus | Craft DC | Rarity   | Cost
----------|-------|------------|----------|----------|-------
Brown     | 1     | 0          | 21       | Uncommon | 3 gp
Black     | 3     | +1         | 24       | Uncommon | 15 gp
Gray      | 9     | +2         | 26       | Rare     | 110 gp
Blue      | 12    | +3         | 29       | Rare     | 350 gp
Prismatic | 19    | +4         | 31       | Rare     | 800 gp

*Note: There's less grades here than given in the actual Technology Guide. This is because gaining an item bonus higher than 3 is almost impossible in 2e while the Technology Guide wanted to give you a +5 by Level 4.*

## Emergency Beacon

**Traits** Uncommon, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Price** 55 gp; **Usage** structure; **Bulk** 2 **Capacity** 30; **Power Use** 1 charge/8 hours; **Craft DC** 25.

A DC 15 Track action can follow the beacon's signal.

## Filter Mask

**Traits** Uncommon, Air, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Price** 250 gp; **Usage** worn mask; **Bulk** L **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour; **Craft DC** 24.

Wearing the mask gives a +2 item bonus to all saving throws made to resist inhaled poisons and diseases even when not activated.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Power Use** 1 charge/hour **Effect** The creature wearing the mask becomes immune to all inhaled poisons and diseases.

## Fire Extinguisher

**Traits** Consumable, Gadget

**Level** 6; **Price** 400 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1; **Uses** 10; **Craft DC** 26

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** You create 15 foot cone of misty vapor that extinguishes all nonmagical fires within its area of effect. For each continuous magical fire effect in the cone, make a counteract check at a +11 modifier. If it succeeds the effect is suppressed for 1 minute before it automatically reignites. A creature affected by persistent fire damage within the cone of effect may make a DC 10 flat check to end their condition immediately.

**Activate** (2 actions) Ready; **Effect** You ready the fire extinguisher to put out any potential sources of instantaneous fire such as a [*fireball*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=119). If the source of fire is within a 15-foot cone of you, you may use your reaction to make a counteract check at a +11 modifier to counter the effect entirely.

## Flashlight

**Traits** Light, [Powered^](/Traits/README.md#powered), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Price** 3 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Capacity** 10; **Power Use** 1 charge/8 hours; **Craft DC** 16

A flashlight emits bright light in a 60 foot cone and dim light in the next 60 feet when activated.

## Goo Tube

**Traits** Consumable

**Price** 3 sp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -; **Craft DC** 14

## Grenade

**Traits** Uncommon, Bomb, Consumable, [Grenade^](/Traits/README.md#grenade), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 20

Grenades are explosives that can be thrown anywhere within 60 feet, with an area of effect as a 20-foot burst. However it is similar to beads on a *[necklace of fireballs](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=449)* where if it is a particularly difficult situation the GM may ask you to make an attack roll (treat as a bomb: martial proficiency with a 20 foot range increment).

Grenades need to be armed before activating, and go off at the start of the user's next turn after being primed - regardless if it has been thrown or not. When a grenade goes off, targets in the area of effect usually have to make a basic Reflex save; the DC and effect depends on the grenade.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Effect** You arm the grenade. It will activate at the start of your next turn, whether you have thrown it or not.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact (ranged); **Effect** You toss the grenade at any area within 60 feet. If this action is disrupted - such as by a critical hit from an [Attack of Opportunity](http://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=8) - you drop the grenade on the ground directly beneath you.

Here is a list of the various kinds of grenades and their effects.

Grenade               | Level | Price  | Save DC       | Extra Traits      | Effect

Zero Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Cold              | 5d6 cold damage

## Grippers

**Level** 1; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 14

Grippers can be used like a crowbar, negating the -2 item penalty to pry something open without one. To pull apart two items attached together with Grippers requires a DC 22 Athletics check.

Grippers can also be used in combat.

**Activate** (2 actions) Interact; **Effect** Make a Strike, treating the grippers as an improvised weapon. On a successful hit, the grippers deal 1d4+7 points of bludgeoning damage.

## Ion Tape

**Traits** Consumable, [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Level** 3; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 14

When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Escape check to break.

## Medlance

**Traits** Uncommon, Injection, [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Level** 5; **Price** 30 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -; **Craft DC** 23

A medlance doesn't use electrical charges, but after 10 uses its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and it becomes useless.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact or Strike; **Effect** You inject the liquid in the medlance into the target. If the target is unwilling, make a Strike against their AC (treat the medlance as a simple one-handed melee weapon). On a hit you do no damage, but the liquid is injected. This changes the ingested trait on poisons to the injury trait.

## Nanite Canister

**Traits** Rare, Consumable, [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Price** 30 gp; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 25

## Nanite Hypogun

**Activate** varies, usually 10 minutes; **Nanite Use** 5 charges; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its secondary setting. This has the effect listed in the Secondary column of the table below.

## Skillchip

**Traits** [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge concerning a single Lore skill, granting an item bonus to checks made using that skill. It must be slotted into a [skillslot](../Cybertech/README.md#skillslot) before it can provide the benefits. All skillchips have negligible bulk.

Model    | Level | Cost   | Bonus | Rarity   | Craft DC

You cannot use a trauma pack in this fashion for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set above 20.

## Veemod

**Traits** Rare, [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

Veemods slot into [Veemod Goggles](#veenmod-goggles) and are useless without them. All veemods have negligible bulk.
